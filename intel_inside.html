        <p><strong>"Ingredient branding"</strong></p>
        <p>During this period, Intel undertook two major supporting advertising campaigns. The first campaign, the 1991 "Intel Inside" marketing and branding campaign, is widely known and has become synonymous with Intel itself. The idea of "ingredient branding" was new at the time, with only NutraSweet and a few others making attempts to do so.This campaign established Intel, which had been a component supplier little-known outside the PC industry, as a household name.</p>
        <p><strong>Intel's Systems Group</strong></p>
        <p>The second campaign, Intel's Systems Group, which began in the early 1990s, showcased manufacturing of PC motherboards, the main board component of a personal computer, and the one into which the processor (CPU) and memory (RAM) chips are plugged.The Systems Group campaign was lesser known than the Intel Inside campaign.</p>
        <p>Shortly after, Intel began manufacturing fully configured "white box" systems for the dozens of PC clone companies that rapidly sprang up.At its peak in the mid-1990s, Intel manufactured over 15% of all PCs, making it the third-largest supplier at the time.</p>

        <p><strong>Intel Architecture Labs</strong></p>
        <p>During the 1990s, Intel Architecture Labs (IAL) was responsible for many of the hardware innovations for the PC, including the PCI Bus, the PCI Express (PCIe) bus, and Universal Serial Bus (USB). IAL's software efforts met with a more mixed fate; its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video,[citation needed] but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from Microsoft. The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by then IAL Vice-President Steven McGeady at the Microsoft antitrust trial (United States v. Microsoft Corp.).</p>
